# 3. The Game class is still doing too much (running the game, comparing player moves, etc.). Letâ€™s create a Rules class to which we can delegate the job of comparing moves to determine the round winner, and to which we can delegate the job of holding the list of valid moves. This means that neither the Game class nor the Player class will have to know anything about the rules of the game; they'll only have to be able to prompt the Rules class to settle things.
